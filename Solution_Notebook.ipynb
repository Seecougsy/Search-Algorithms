    "#### Algorithm Implementation.\n",
    "Completing this project presented challenges in maintaining full visibility of the search strategy. Despite my experience with several Python projects, there were still some bugs and problems encountered that could be attributed to my limited experience. Significant effort and knowledge on the algorithm and Python packages were required to be investigated to verify that the algorithm accurately produced the expected solution path for the algorithms as a result of the algorithm exhibiting the correct search behavior, and not just a chance result. Printing debug statements within the code was the most useful approach.  There were also a number of issues and bugs that I encountered that were related to incorrect implementation of `variable scope` and was returning unexpected outputs. You will be able to see, with the remaining time, I was not able to fix the goal state colour and the traversal colour. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expressing Technical Concepts.\n",
    "Selecting how to present this project was a key challenge. It was important to present important details and knowledge, without being overly complex or long. Visualisations were also an important factor in this project. This involved selecting the appropriate Python packages for visualizing the algorithms while also considering the feasibility of being able to execute the desired result given the timeline. There were some changes in the time available to complete this project, I have worked with Matplotlib a number of times, ultimately this is what drove the decision.\n",

    "## Breadth First Search - *Uninformed Search*\n",
    "- Breadth First Search (BFS) explores all nodes at each depth, before expanding nodes at a layer under.  This means unlike DFS, the node in the frontier are explored using a First In First Out (FIFO) queue, where the *oldest* discovered node is expanded first.\n",

    "- Initializes the frontier using the initial state of the problem. Explore set = None.\n",
